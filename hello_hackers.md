# Intro to Commands

### In this challenge we print the username through the command whoami.
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{kbGLjBMtEX9FyLyaBeej5TQcbVG.QX3YjM1wCN2kjNzEzW}`

The command whoami prints our username.We get the flag by the hello command. 

```

#!/bin/bash

whoami

mahi

hello

flag generated

```

## What I learnt

Linux is case sensitive 


# Intro to Arguments

### We learn about the additional data passed to commands called arguments
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{QSXAmE9Gmeg_U6gBrnZwaUmmgnu.QX4YjM1wCN2kjNzEzW}`

In echo hello hackers, echo is the command while hello hackers is the argument. To get the flag we ran hello command with single argument hackers.
```

#!/bin/bash

echo hello hackers

hello hackers

hello hackers

flag generated

```

## What I learnt

Difference between command and argument.



# Command history

### Shell saves a history of every command we invoke
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wDBrSXX_ljwBierkt0pzMPNYAyD.0lNzEzNxwCN2kjNzEzW}`

The arrows-up and down help us to navigate our history. The flag was automatically visible when we typed history.
